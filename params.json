{"name":"Sensor Web","tagline":"Android App:  Takes sensor data and uploads to an ip address","body":"### Welcome \r\nThis Android App is for an upcoming installation by artist [Florian Meisenberg](http://www.wentrupgallery.com/artist/florian-meisenberg/).  The app will take all the sensor data from your phone and send it to a specific ip address and port.  At the ip, listening at the correct port will be a Max/MSP program which can convert the data to an interactive video artwork.\r\n\r\n### Public Use\r\nAny public use, of course will not affect the Meisenberg installation.  However you will be able to select the ip address and port you wish to use.  For it to work correctly while the phone is off site/not on the same wireless network as the connecting computer, the router at the ip address must use port forwarding.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
